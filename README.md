## Overview

Onis is a web service that provides a RESTful API for managing a tree structure of names used by annotation tools and data catalogs. We typically call this tree structure a "knowledgebase" (aka "KB"). Tree structures are useful for modeling organism phylogeny. At MBARI, we also include other terms, such as geological features and equipment used for research.
